Thanks to this assessment, I had the opportunity to learn blender, modeling
and rendering for the first time. Blender it a very complete and powerful tool
which provide many interesting features and I tried some of the following for
this project.

### Architecture design

Blender offers many features for project organization. I could use multiple
files for each object, and link them together. Also create several scenes for
the different point of views in the main file. And finally, I could use layers
when I wanted to just display some objects instead of the full scene which
can be very useful sometimes.

### Bezier curves

As in Illustrator, Blender as a bezier curve tool which is very useful to draw
paths. I used it for chairs feet or seats borders for instance.

### Physic simulation

I used the physic simulation, more precisely the Clothes simulation to generate
the shape of the flag curtain. This is very convenient because you can easily
tweak the parameters and save the final result at the frame you want as your
final geometry.

### Sculpting

For the menu or the napkin I also wanted some irregularities but the cloth
simulation didn't work well. That's why I used the sculpting tool on subdivided
plans instead.

### Cycle Rendering

This render mode is very powerful. It allows to generate very precise materials
by combining shaders. One of the most powerful feature is that you can not only
update the color of the vertices but also the normals and even the geometry.
Moreover, you also have many functions to do some operations on colors (thanks
to that I could very easily change the colors of the star pattern of the
window whenever I need to).

### Procedural textures

One of my favorite feature in cycle rendering is procedural textures. Indeed,
there is several procedural textures that you can use in the material node
editor which helped me to generate interesting procedural materials including
booth seat's and chair's leather and floor patterns.
